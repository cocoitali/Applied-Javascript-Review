##Part One (The Menu):

Once you load the page, you will notice a menu in the upper left side of the page. Currently when you click on it nothing happens. You will build out the functionality to allow a dropdown menu to open and close when a user clicks on the dropdown button.

#1 Study the HTML in the index.html file corresponding to the menu component.

#2 Study the LESS file in the Menu folder.

#3 With your knowledge of the HTML and CSS, complete the Menu.js file. You will be creating a dropdown menu component.


##Part Two (Buttons):

Now you will be creating a complex component made up of itself and sister component. The greater component wrapper will be called ButtonLink and the smaller component it will create will be called ButtonInfo.

The ButtonLink component will be the overall wrapper of the sub component. 

This higher level component will find and create the sub component within it. This component will be on each of what we may consider the tabs on top of the box. These links will control the associated item, as well as selecting and deselecting themselves.

The ButtonInfo component will be the text displayed when a tab is selected. It will share a data attribute with it's corresponding tab, and should only show when it's tab has been selected.

#4 Complete the Buttons.js file

Notice that it starts at the bottom of the page and then jumps around. Pay attention to what is being called and when. Study the corresponding HTML and LESS to get a better idea of how the tabs were built.

Once you have completed the above, add a couple new Buttons to the HTML in order to see first hand how great building webpages with components is!
